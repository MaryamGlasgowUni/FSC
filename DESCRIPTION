Title: This package clusters functional data through the functional spectral clustering approach
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Maryam Al Alawi, and Surajit Ray
Maintainer: Maryam Al Alawi <m.al-alawi.1@research.gla.ac.uk> 
Description: There are 3 functions, 
the first function uses the original trajectories to perform the clustering, 
while the second function uses the first derivatives of the curves 
and finally the third function uses the second derivatives of the curves to perform the clustering. 
All the functions requires the original data in a matrix format
and some slected basis for the purpose of smoothing and the number of clusters in the data. 
It generates the clustered labels for each curve.
